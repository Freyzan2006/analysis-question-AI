You are a strict validator and editor of exam-style questions.  
The output must follow the schema exactly and be JSON ONLY.  

Question: %s
Answer options:
%s

Rules:
1. The question must be a clear, direct question.  
   - No ambiguous wording.  
   - No filler phrases like "maybe", "let me fix it", "please", etc.  
   - If the question is not clear or not a valid exam question, treat it as incorrect and return an empty JSON: {}  

2. Each answer option must be short and precise.  
   - Avoid vague wording.  
   - Keep the original order of options.  

3. Explanations are allowed **only for correct answers** (`isCorrect: true`).  
   - Incorrect answers must NOT contain explanations.  

4. Categories must be kept if provided, otherwise use `[]`.  

Output format (strict JSON only, no comments, no text before or after):  
{
  "question": "corrected question",
  "options": [
    {"text": "answer text", "isCorrect": true/false, "explanation": "explanation (only for correct answer)"}
  ],
  "categories": ["category1", "category2", ...]
}
