    "Question": "A project involves three phases with uncertain costs. Phase 1 has a 50% chance of costing $5,000. Phase 2 has a 30% chance of costing $10,000. Phase 3 has a 20% chance of costing $22,500. What is the expected total cost of the project assuming these are independent and additive?",
    "Options": [
      {
        "Text": "$10,000",
        "IsCorrect": true,
        "Explanation": "The expected total cost is the sum of the expected costs for each phase. Expected Cost (Phase 1) = 0.5 * $5,000 = $2,500. Expected Cost (Phase 2) = 0.3 * $10,000 = $3,000. Expected Cost (Phase 3) = 0.2 * $22,500 = $4,500. Therefore, Expected Total Cost = $2,500 + $3,000 + $4,500 = $10,000."
