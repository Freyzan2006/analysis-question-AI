    "Question": "A project's total cost is the sum of the costs of its three independent phases. The cost of each phase is uncertain, representing a specific risk:\n- Phase 1: There is a 50% probability of a cost of $5,000, and a 50% probability of a cost of $0.\n- Phase 2: There is a 30% probability of a cost of $10,000, and a 70% probability of a cost of $0.\n- Phase 3: There is a 20% probability of a cost of $22,500, and an 80% probability of a cost of $0.\nWhat is the expected total cost of the project?",

        "Text": "$10,000",
        "IsCorrect": true,
        "Explanation": "The total expected cost is the sum of the expected costs for each phase. The expected cost for a single phase is calculated by multiplying the potential cost by its probability.\n- Expected cost for Phase 1 = 0.50 * $5,000 = $2,500\n- Expected cost for Phase 2 = 0.30 * $10,000 = $3,000\n- Expected cost for Phase 3 = 0.20 * $22,500 = $4,500\n\nTotal Expected Cost = $2,500 + $3,000 + $4,500 = $10,000."
