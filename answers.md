### Вопрос 1
1) $10,000
_Пояснение_: The expected total cost is the sum of the expected costs for each phase. Expected Cost (Phase 1) = 0.5 * $5,000 = $2,500. Expected Cost (Phase 2) = 0.3 * $10,000 = $3,000. Expected Cost (Phase 3) = 0.2 * $22,500 = $4,500. Therefore, Expected Total Cost = $2,500 + $3,000 + $4,500 = $10,000.

2) $12,000

3) $8,000

4) $15,000
