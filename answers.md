### Вопрос 1
1) $10,000
_Пояснение_: The total expected cost is the sum of the expected costs for each phase. The expected cost for a single phase is calculated by multiplying the potential cost by its probability.
- Expected cost for Phase 1 = 0.50 * $5,000 = $2,500
- Expected cost for Phase 2 = 0.30 * $10,000 = $3,000
- Expected cost for Phase 3 = 0.20 * $22,500 = $4,500

Total Expected Cost = $2,500 + $3,000 + $4,500 = $10,000.

2) $12,000

3) $8,000

4) $15,000
